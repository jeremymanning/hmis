Welcome to hmis_'s documentation!
=================================

`hmis <https://github.com/mattbellis/hmis>`_ is a python module that provides
tools for manipulating and visualizing data in the `HMIS (Homelessness
Information Management System) <https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/>`_ format, a format defined by HUD (Housing
and Urban Development). Homelessness support organizations that receive funds from 
HUD are mandated to collect information on clients who receive assistance. 
Many organizations collect this data, but there are no common tools to analyze it. 
The hmis package allows the user to take a standard data dump from an 
HMIS database and build a format more suited to data exploration. 
Additional analysis tools are also provided by this package.
